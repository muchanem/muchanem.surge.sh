  I am at the forum waiting for the next debate. This week has been
strange first the animals at the amphitheater refused to fight. In
genral all the animals have been acting strange. We are having
a debate about what is happening. Anyways I'm not staying for long
just in case somtrhings bad happenins. 
  30 minutes later: the debate is finally over the people have decided that nothing is probablly wrong
and all these mini earthquakes we are getting is why all the animals
are unrestful.
  2 hours later there was just a huge earthquake I decided that I am
going to leave on my horse.
  1 hour later I am riding a galloping horse away from the
mountain. My horse races through the plains and the hot
wind whips at my hair and clothes. The pyroclastic flow of
Vesuvius is coming for me!!
  1 day later. I made it to the next town which has a harbor I am
going straight to Rome to tell what happened, and if we are facing
Jupiter's raith. The gas cloud is heading towards the town so I asked
the captian to add extra rowers so we can run away quicker my jutny
nakes serval days but I finally arrvied in rome I put on my toga to go
tto the forum and tell what happened.
