This was the best day every on the Moon settelment we just got a new
shipment of bacon to the settlement Bob the person in the room across from
be said he became vegitarian but that changed when the new shipment of bacon
came. You might ask why were you so interensted in a shipment of of bacon,
well the normal food is just freeze dried junk that we rehydrate. The
really annoying sshing libaraian at the library got to the bacon first so
that was kind of annoying.
