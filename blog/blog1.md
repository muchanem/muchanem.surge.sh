Wee watch a film about the sunken ship and it shows us a video about how the
scientists found the ship wreck "Seaweed shimmers under the glassy cool
translucent waves. I am 40 feet below, exploring the shipwreck of the Senora
de Atocha. My boat is loaded with treasure!! Aztec emeralds as big as your
face!!! But all of the sudden, something goes terribly wrong." we leave the
exipit on the ship and continue on to the beach
