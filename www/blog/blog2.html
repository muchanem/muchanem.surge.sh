<p>We just left the exibit and we were
leaving to go to the hotel so we could drop off our suit cases.
I was not reading becuase it was a short car ride. I heard over the radio
that they were having a call in contest for a writing prompt it goes like
this I am trapped in the Bermuda Triangle, on a too small sailboat, with
a dumb crew member who just ate the last CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKE. The rest of
the crew has disappeared... I don&#39;t know what happened, but I hear strange
sounds coming from the water at night. They don&#39;t sound like seagulls...
We get to the hotel the people had left a mess there was a half-eaten pizza,
a book on telepathy, a sleeve of saltine crackers, a book onmagic, a six-pack of Dr.
Pepper. Whew that was A LOT of stuff well I read my book
while I waited for the cleaning people to come the sciencetist said in the
book &quot;I had a lot of existential angst while I waited to be saved</p>
